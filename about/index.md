## About PyTennessee 2019

* February 9-10, 2019
* Nashville School of Law
* Nashville, TN

PyTennessee is a yearly regional Python conference held every February in Nashville, TN.
The conference was started in 2014 by Jason Myers and Will Golden, and has been a staple of the conference calendar every year since.
PyTennessee 2019 will be our 6th year, and like every year before it, promises to be our best yet!
Much like in years past, PyTennessee 2019 will feature 2 keynote talks, 3 speaking tracks, 1 tutorial track, and an always-excellent hallway track.
The conference will provide breakfast and lunch both days (and will also provide meal alternatives to suit as many dietary restrictions as possible), will host a Game Night/After Party on Saturday, and will provide programming education through our Young Coders program.

PyTennessee is a nonprofit event facilitated by TechFed Nashville, a Tennessee nonprofit organization whose mission is to support and grow the grassroots tech talent in Middle Tennessee through educational events and groups.
TechFed provides financial stewardship, risk management and volunteer leadership development for Nashville-area technology events.

PyTennessee endeavors to be a diverse conference dedicated to providing an enjoyable experience to everyone. Help us do this by following our code of conduct.


## About the Talks

PyTennessee is a developer-focused Python conference with talk topics running the gamut between beginner and advanced, and from web development to data science and machine learning.
The majority of our talks are Python-focused, but in addition to the Python-related topics, we also look for and encourage Python-adjacent and "professional skills" talks to provide a more complete experience.
Developers are more than the single language they write in, and PyTennessee attempts to reflect that in our talk selection.
